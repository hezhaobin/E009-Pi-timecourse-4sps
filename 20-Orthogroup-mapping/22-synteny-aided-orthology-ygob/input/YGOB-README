    Data from the Yeast Gene Order Browser (YGOB)
 	        Version 7 (Aug2012)

======================================================

 (1) Pillars.tab [1 file]

 This file lists all of the homology pillars used in 
 YGOB with columns for each of the available 
 positions in a pillar. Only genes that are turned 
 ON in YGOB are included in this file (OFF genes are 
 not considered to be real features, and hence listing 
 them in pillars on their own would be redundant) 

 These are, from left to right:

   V. polyspora Position 1
   T. phaffii Position 1
   T. blattae Position 1
   N. dairenensis Position 1
   N. castellii Position 1
   K. naganishii Position 1
   K. africana Position 1
   C. glabrata Position 1
   S. bayanus var. uvarum Position 1
   S. kudriavzevii Position 1
   S. mikatae Position 1
   S. cerevisiae Position 1
   Ancestral Gene Order
   Z. rouxii
   T. delbrueckii
   K. lactis
   E. gossypii 
   E. cymbalariae
   L. kluyveri
   L. thermotolerans
   L. waltii
   S. cerevisiae Position 2
   S. mikatae Position 2
   S. kudriavzevii Position 2
   S. bayanus var. uvarum Position 2
   C. glabrata Position 2
   K. africana Position 2
   K. naganishii Position 2
   N. castellii Position 2
   N. dairenensis Position 2
   T. blattae Position 2
   T. phaffii Position 2
   V. polyspora Position 2

 The order of the columns and the genes is ARBITRARY,
 and does NOT indicate presence on an A or B "track",
 or any syntenic relationships. This file just 
 contains the underlying homology assignments used
 in YGOB. For syntenic information for a locus or 
 region of interest the '+' button in the bottom 
 left hand corner of the YGOB interface will output 
 syntenic information in a tab delimited text format. 
 

 (2) *_genome.tab [21 files]  

 These files are ordered lists of the genes in each 
 of the genomes included in this version of YGOB. 
 The columns contain, from left to right:

 - NAME - unambiguous name used to identify the gene
 - ORIENTATION - 0 = Crick Strand, 1 = Watson Strand
 - START COORDINATE - 5' start of the co-ordinate range of the feature
 - STOP COORDINATE - 3' end of the co-ordinate range of the feature
 - ON/OFF - whether feature is displayed or not in YGOB
 - CHROMOSOME/CONTIG/SCAFFOLD NUMBER - identifying number of source sequence
 - SHORT NAME - the shorter name that will appear in the gene box on screen in YGOB
 - COORDINATES - complete gene co-ordinates with intron/exon annotation and complement tag if appropriate
 - NOTES - GenBank tags, SGD descriptions and notes for the locus

 The only exception being the 'Ancestor_genome.tab' file as
 the ancestral gene order has no underlying sequence and hence
 no co-ordinates. In this case the columns are:

 - NAME - unambiguous name used to identify the gene
 - ORIENTATION - 0 = Crick Strand, 1 = Watson Strand (inferred from homologs)
 - ON/OFF - whether feature is displayed or not in YGOB
 - CHROMOSOME NUMBER - identifying number of ancestral chromosome
 - SHORT NAME - the shorter name that will appear in the gene box on screen in YGOB


 (3) *_sequence.fsa [20 files]  

 The nucleotide sequences (in FASTA format) of the 
 chromosomes, contigs or scaffolds (denoted by 'Chr', 
 'c' and 's' prefixes, respectively - which one is used 
 depends on the particular genome assembly) from each of
 the genomes featured in YGOB (the ancestral gene order 
 has no underlying sequence).


 (4) AA.fsa [1 file] 

 Protein sequences (in FASTA format) for the protein coding 
 genes in the above annotation files.


 (5) NT.fsa [1 file] 

 Nucleotide sequences (in FASTA format) for the protein coding 
 genes in the above annotation files.


 (6) tRNA.fsa [1 file]

 Nucleotide sequences (in FASTA format) for the transfer RNA genes 
 in the above annotation files


 (7) rRNA.fsa [1 file]

 Nucleotide sequences (in FASTA format) for the ribosomal RNAs in
 the above annotation files


 (8) ncRNA [1 file]

 Nucleotide sequences (in FASTA format) for the non-coding 
 RNA features in the above annotation files (only S. cerevisiae
 ncRNA features are currently annotated)


 (9) snRNA [1 file]

 Nucleotide sequences (in FASTA format) for the small nuclear 
 RNA features in the above annotation files (only S. cerevisiae
 snRNA features are currently annotated)


 (10) snoRNA [1 file]

 Nucleotide sequences (in FASTA format) for the small nucleolar
 RNA features in the above annotation files (only S. cerevisiae
 snoRNA features are currently annotated)
