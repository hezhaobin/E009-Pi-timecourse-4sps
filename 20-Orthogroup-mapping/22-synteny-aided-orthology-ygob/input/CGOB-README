 Pillars.tab

 This file lists all of the homology pillars used in CGOB
 with columns for each of the available positions in a 
 pillar. Only genes that are turned ON in CGOB are 
 included in this file (OFF genes are not considered to be 
 real features, and hence listing them in pillars on their
 own would be redundant). 
 The order of the columns and the genes is ARBITRARY
 and just contains the underlying homology assignments used
 in CGOB. 

These are, from left to right:

C. albicans SC5314
C. albicans WO-1
C. dubliniensis
C. tropicalis
C. tropicalis Version 1
C. parapsilosis		
C. metapsilosis
C. orthopsilosis
C. orthopsilosis Version 1
L. elongisporus				
D. hansenii							
Sch. stipitis (Pichia stipitis)								
M. guilliermondii (Candida guillermondii)			 
C. lusitaniae   
C. auris
S. cerevisiae
