# Goal
Nutrients are limited in environments and availability depends on abiotic and biotic factors. Therefore response to nutrient depleted/starvation conditions is critical for survival, especially in planktonic and/or sessile organisms. While core stress responses are conserved, variability among transcriptional programs between closely related species exists, suggesting species specific evolution of core transcriptional responses. How gene regulatory networks evolve is an open question, especially given constant environmental nutrient flux. Here we compare the transcriptional response to phosphate starvation between four yeast species to identify gene regulatory programs and kinetics which differ among species assayed. 

# Experimental Design
To compare the gene expression changes during phosphate starvation across species, we conducted a time course RNAseq experiment. Gene expression was measured in C. glabrata, S. cerevisae, K. lactis, and C. albicans before starvation and during incubation in 0mM Pi media for 8hrs. mRNA-sequencing was performed to measure gene expression changes.
